## Minutes

### SUMMARY:

DISCUSSION

 - Client library implementations of 4.3 auth flows
   - C++ - native, pam_password, pam_interactive
   - Python - native, pam_password, pam_interactive
   - Java - native, pam_password, pam_interactive (via irods4j)
   - Go - none - will start seeing 'legacy' warnings with irods5
     - Investigate creating an issue or two in the go-irodsclient repo
 - OIDC/OAuth2 in HTTP API
   - Client mode removed in v0.6.0, protected resource only
   - JWT verification
     - Support for encrypted JWTs (once jwt-cpp is updated enough)
 - Syncing external user lists/groups -> iRODS user table
   - Part of conversation with Sanger as well
   - https://github.com/harrykodden/irods-ldap-sync 
   - https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7644 SCIM
     - iRODS would be a client
     - https://github.com/harrykodden/scim
     - Harry has recently added an irods plugin
       - https://github.com/HarryKodden/scim/commit/06aa44dc20ce6eac94d6408df11f579645261d18 
       - Handles transferring ownership in case of an empty group
 - FIPS compliance
   - Working to remove known MD5/SHA1 codepaths
     - Hash the user password for challenge string on the wire
       - Switch to SHA256 instead, in the near-term
       - Server would have an option to enable MD5, for a while
     - Enqueueing the id of the delay rules
       - For uniqueness, should be trivial to swap
       - Not used for lookups we think
       - Or just UUID?
     - Mockarchive to generate physical paths
       - Only used for iRODS testing
       - For uniqueness, if so, easy to swap also
     - Decoder ring uses multiple MD5 in the loops
       - May only go away when tokens are used instead
       - Not sure we can change how decoder ring works
     - Checksum algorithm for data objects
       - SHA256 is already the default (since … 4.2.0?)
       - Server will at some point… no longer support MD5
 - Full Migration to Tokens
   - Token generated at the beginning of a 'session' via challenge/response
   - Token included/used for all other operations
 - Next Meeting
   - September 2025
